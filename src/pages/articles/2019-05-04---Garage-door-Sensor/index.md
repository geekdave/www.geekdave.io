When we pull our car into the garage with the kids in tow, we've usually got a whole bunch of distractions going on. And when we're entering the house, we've usually got our hands full. So it's no wonder one of the most common things that my wife and I forget to do is close the garage door. Since we live in Colorado, this presents a problem in the form of a cuddly-looking animal who needs to eat about 30,000 calories per day. Bears like to get into trash cans, and our trash cans are stored in the garage. Oftentimes we'll depart the house in the morning only to realize that we'd left the garage door open all night long.
